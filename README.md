Laboratory Activity in CS223 - Discrete Structures 2

The purpose of this Laboratory Activity is to demonstrate our understanding in how functions work, taking input and yielding an output. The program's input has a one-to-one relationship between the input and the output.

P.S.
This program is not responsive, as that is not the purpose of this program. Zoom out 80% is recommended.
